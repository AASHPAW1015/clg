00:30.000 --> 00:35.006
Money get away

00:36.374 --> 00:42.434
Get a good job with more pay and you’re O.K.

00:44.029 --> 00:48.878
Money it’s a gas

00:49.800 --> 00:55.800
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash

00:57.734 --> 01:01.860
New car caviar four star daydream

01:01.860 --> 01:06.352
Think I’ll buy me a football team

01:11.484 --> 01:15.420
Money get back

01:17.679 --> 01:22.468
I’m alright Jack keep your hands off my stack

01:24.942 --> 01:28.920

01:36.951 --> 01:42.544
I’m in the hi-fidelity first class travelling set

01:42.545 --> 01:46.317
And I think I need a Lear jet

03:37.507 --> 03:41.870
Money it’s a crime

03:43.621 --> 03:48.565
Share it fairly but don’t take a slice of my pie

03:50.643 --> 03:54.640
Money so they say

03:56.673 --> 04:01.770
Is the root of all evil today

04:03.639 --> 04:11.038
But if you ask for a rise it’s no surprise that they’re giving none away
